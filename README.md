# XMB Wave CLI Animation

This is a command-line animation that replicates the iconic wave effect from the PlayStation 3 XMB (Cross Media Bar) menu.

Originally inspired by the smooth, flowing motion of the PS3's system interface, this project brings a minimalist version of that aesthetic into the terminal.

## Features

- Terminal-based wave animation
- Purely visual â€“ just for fun

## Build Instructions

This project consists of a single C++ file: `waves.cpp`.

### Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`)
- A Unix-like terminal (Linux/macOS/WSL)

### Compile and Run

```bash
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -o waves waves.cpp
./waves
```

## Inspiration

Inspired by the PlayStation 3's XMB menu and its signature animated background.
